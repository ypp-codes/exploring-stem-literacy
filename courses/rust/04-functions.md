# Functions

## What is a Function?

## A function is a block of code that is reusable. One reason to create one is when some extremely similar code appears a lot in your code. Another reason is for clarity, sometimes your code can look extremely messy and itâ€™s better to put some of it on its own.

Example:

# Task

# Finale: In English

- ## What did we do today?

  ## In your own words, describe what we worked on today.

## What went wrong, what went right?

## How did you feel at the end of it all?
